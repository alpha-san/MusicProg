# MusicProg

An easy way to learn music theory via creating chord progressions.

This project was created using [Tonal](https://github.com/danigb/tonal), [Tone.js](https://github.com/Tonejs/Tone.js), and [MidiWriterJS](https://github.com/grimmdude/MidiWriterJS).

Here is a [demo](https://peaceful-falls-54029.herokuapp.com/).

## Current Features

* Create a chord progression by selecting a scale and then selecting chords corresponding to that scale
* Export chord progression into .MID file

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
